Conway-3d
=========

Adaptation of the conway life game in 3D with JavaFX

Rules
-----

* Each cell surrounded by 10 alive cells will be alive on next step
* Each cell surrounded by less than 7 cells or more than 10 cells will die on next step

NB: this values are proportional to the ratio of the Conway life game in 2D:
  * 3 / 8 (neighbors) = 0.375 and 10 / 26 (neighbors) = 0.384
  * 2 / 8 (neighbors) = 0.25 and 7 / 26 (neighbors) = 0.269 


A test was also conducted with traditional Conway life game values.
